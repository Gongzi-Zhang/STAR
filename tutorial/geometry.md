* Coordinate system:
  * Positive y is up.
  * The origin of the coordinate system is located at the center of the solenoid
    (iron). The direction y is perpendicular to the axis of the solenoid. The y-z
    plane is vertical and positive y points opposite (as closely as possible) the
    direction of gravity.
  * Positive x points approximately south and away from center of the RHIC
    accelerator. Positive z points westward.
  * The direction of the RHIC beam is defined by a view looking down upon the
    accelerator. At our detector the clockwise beam travels toward positive z and
    the counter-clockwise beam moves toward negative z.
